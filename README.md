#Capabilities:
This repository is able to solve the problem for the coding challenge. It is able to display the right information, the right fields, and the right computations of sum and count.

#Testing
I faced issues with the tests because of an error that kept occurring as a result of the new line at the end of the file and I could not solve it. I tried many different ways to solve it but I could not find the best way. At the end, for some reason i reached the point were the test passed in python 3.5 and failed in 3.6 and 3.7.

#Tradeoffs:
Some tradeoffs faced were deciding whether to save the processing files in new objects or more iterations through for loops over the data set to reach specific golas.

#Final Comment
- Considering the tight timeline I had to submit the project, I did not have enough time to be creative and try more ways to make the tests work as efficiently as possible. However, the current output file meets the basic requirement and shows the expected content.
